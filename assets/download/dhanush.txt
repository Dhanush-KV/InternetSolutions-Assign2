Welcome!  Hey, This is Dhanush Kandasamy Velsamy. 

Passionate about data science, data analysis, and software development, I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree at Maynooth University, Ireland. During my undergraduate studies in computer science engineering at Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College, I gained hands-on experience through internships in Chennai, where I explored various aspects of business and technology.

My hobbies are playing badminton and cricket, and also I like to listen to music and audio podcasts. I also like to do video editing and worked in my college media team for symposium in my UG degree.
